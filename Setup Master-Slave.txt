Steps:

a. Setup on Node Server (Linux):

- Create an EC2 Instance, install java, git.
- Create a root directory (which is to be accessed by Master): 
	- cd /tmp
	- mkdir jenkinsdir
- Give read/write/execute access to it (Jenkins User):
	- chmod -R 777 /tmp/jenkinsdir

b. Setup on Jenkins master:

	- Manage jenkins → Configure system → Scroll down to jenkins location and change the Jenkins URL to be the latest URL: http://3.147.195.251(Public_ip of Instance):8080/
	- Manage Jenkins → Manage nodes and Clouds:
	- Add New Node: Give node name: slave1 - Select Permanent Agent
		- Number of executors: 1(eg.) - ( Executors means Parellel jobs that can be dispatched to the nodes )
		- Remote root directory: /tmp/jenkinsdir
		- Labels : slave1 ( Labels is just a tag or alias name which is used to dispatch the jobs selectively to the node)
		- Usage : select second option from dropdown ( which ever job has this label will be dispatched to this node )
		- Launch method: launch agents via ssh
		- Host : private ip address of slave machine
		- Add Jenkins Credentials:
			- Kind: SSH Username with private key
			- Give Id and Desc.
			- Username: ec2_user (username of the ec2_Instance)
			- Enter the private key (pem file)
		- Host key verifying Strategy: Non verifying Verification Strategy
		--------------------------------------(Master will connect to the Node)-------------------------------------------

- Dispatch the Job to the Node server:
	- Go to Job Configure section:
		- Check "Restrict where this project can be run" - Mention the Label expression

Adding the agent on the pipeline code:

pipeline{
	agent {label '<label_name>'}
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a. Setup on Node Server (Windows):

- Git, Java should be installed in the Windows system.
- Create a remote root directory (which is to be accessed by Master): 
	- Go inside C:\
	- Create a folder jenkinsdir

b. Setup on Jenkins master:

	- Manage jenkins → Configure system → Scroll down to jenkins location and change the Jenkins URL to be the latest URL: http://3.147.195.251(Public_ip of Instance):8080/
	- Open the Agent port:
		- Manage Jenkins - Configure Global Security - Select "TCP Portfor inbound agents" RANDOM (only in the case of Windows Agent)
	- Manage Jenkins → Manage nodes and Clouds:
	- Add New Node: Give node name: slave1 - Select Permanent Agent
		- Number of executors: 1(eg.) - ( Executors means Parellel jobs that can be dispatched to the nodes )
		- Remote root directory: C:\jenkinsdir
		- Labels : slave1 ( Labels is just a tag or alias name which is used to dispatch the jobs selectively to the node)
		- Usage : select second option from dropdown ( which ever job has this label will be dispatched to this node )
		- Launch method: launch agents by connecting it to the controller
		- Host : private ip address of slave machine
		- Add Jenkins Credentials:
			- Kind: SSH Username with private key
			- Give Id and Desc.
			- Username: ec2_user (username of the ec2_Instance)
			- Enter the private key (pem file)
		- Host key verifying Strategy: Non verifying Verification Strategy
		- Scroll down to Node properties
		- Select tool location:
			- Add the Git path (Under Program Files)and Java path (not required)
			(make sure JDK and Git configurations are done in Global Tool Configuration)

		- Manage Jenkins → Manage nodes and Clouds - Click on the Agent - Download the jar file
		- Cut and paste the jar file from Downloads to C:\jenkinsdir
		- On windows agent, in CMD prompt, run the mentioned commands inside C:\jenkinsdir (for connection between agent and master)

- Dispatch the Job to the Node server:
	- Go to Job Configure section:
		- Check "Restrict where this project can be run" - Mention the Label expression
